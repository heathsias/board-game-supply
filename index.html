        		meatspace:<br />
        		From cyberpunk novels, meatspace is the world outside of the 'net -- that is to say, the real world, where you do things with your body rather than with your keyboard. William Gibson's novels (Neuromancer, Mona Lisa Overdrive, and Count Zero, in particular) note the difference between the 'Net of the console cowboys &amp; the world of the meat outside.

				On this site you'll find all the gear you need to take over meatspace.<br /><br />
				<b>meatspace:</b><br />
				From cyberpunk novels, meatspace is the world outside of the 'net-- 
				that is to say, the real world, where you do things with your body rather than 
				with your keyboard. William Gibson's novels (Neuromancer, Mona Lisa Overdrive, 
				and Count Zero, in particular) note the difference between the 'Net of the console 
				cowboys and the world of the meat outside.

          <h4>"Supplies for gamers, by gamers, for gamers, by gamers ... for gamers"</h4>
          Nathan was born at an early age and has been gaming ever since.
          Heath likes games, too, and wishes he had more time to play them.<br />
          <br />
          Merchant of Games was formed by a mutual desire to make tons of money selling
          low-margin products to a handful of rabid gamers in Orange County. They also
          had to create a website for an Internet Applications course.<br />
          <br />
          We hope to continue updating the site until such time that is looks like it
          was made in the last decade. In any case, we've had fun making it and that's
          the important thing.<br />
          <br />
          Cheers!
